	<h1>The Story of Paved by the Fallen</h1>
	<h2>A world broken by ancient sins</h2>

	<p>Paved by the Fallen is a tactical survival game where you control the fate of summoned heroes battling through a ruthless tower of trials. No retries. No revives. Just consequences.</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>This world is but one fragment of countless realms, a fragile remnant where ancient forces and forgotten powers shape the fate of all living things. At its heart lies the Ariest Expanse, a land once vibrant and full of life, now caught in the grip of change beyond understanding.</dt>
		<dd>Elios, a scholar turned seeker, arrives driven by visions and truths hidden deep within the fabric of existence. His discovery challenges everything the world believes about freedom, fate, and the nature of choice. With determination, he sets forth on a path to unravel the very strings that bind reality.</dd>
		<dt>As his influence spreads, long-held alliances fracture and ancient orders face unprecedented trials. Echoes of rebellion and philosophies ripple through kingdoms and cults alike, each struggling to grasp what Elios’s vision means for their future, and their survival.</dt>
		<dd>Beyond the borders of the Expanse lie realms where time bends, and death itself is questioned. Strange forces awaken, and old powers stir beneath frozen wastes and deep seas. Those who survive bear witness to events that defy reason and hint at a destiny far larger than any single life.</dd>
